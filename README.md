# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Background Context
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

## Resources
**Read or watch:**

* [Sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
* [Big O notation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation)
* [Sorting algorithms animations](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)
* [15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg) (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)
* [CS50 Algorithms explanation in detail by David Malan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb0PY3LX2x8&t=2s)
* [All about sorting algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

### HAPPY LEARNINGS :-)
